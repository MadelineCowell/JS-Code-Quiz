## About

```
This website deploys an application that engages the user in a timed quiz. This quiz provides the user with 5 coding related questions that are multiple choice. This interactive challenge allows 15 seconds per questions, giving the user a total of 75 seconds to complete the five questions. If the user answers the question CORRECTLY, the next question will appear. However, if the user answers INCORRECTLY, 15 seconds will be deducted from the overall time. Once the quiz is completed or the timer has reach zero, the quiz will end and a score will populate.
